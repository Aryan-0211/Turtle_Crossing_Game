# Turtle Crossing Game

Turtle Crossing is a simple and fun Python game where you control a turtle that has to cross a road while avoiding moving cars. The game gets progressively harder as you level up. The objective is to move the turtle across the screen without getting hit by the cars.

## Features

- Turtle moves forward when the up arrow key is pressed.
- Cars appear randomly and move towards the turtle.
- The game increases in difficulty as you progress, with faster cars as you level up.
- A "Game Over" screen will appear if the turtle collides with a car.

How to Play

    Run the game:

    python main.py

    Use the Up Arrow key to move the turtle forward.

    Once the turtle crosses the road, it will automatically return to the starting position.

    If the turtle collides with a car, the game will end.
